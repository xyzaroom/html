  <h1>Xyzaroom Records Inc. Statement</h1>
  
  <p>Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It can take various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which include the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.</p>
  
  <p>Xyzaroom Records Inc. and its associated brands have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery within its business and supply chains. This policy applies to all persons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working for Xyzaroom Records Inc. or on our behalf, in any capacity, including employees at all levels</li>
    <li>Our contractors, external consultants, and suppliers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Xyzaroom Records Inc. is committed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships</li>
    <li>Implementing and enforcing controls to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere within the business or within our supply chains</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We expect the same high standards from all our suppliers. As part of our contracting process, we include specific prohibitions against modern slavery, and we expect that our Suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.</p>
  
  <p>An employee or supplier must report any incidence or suspicion of modern slavery at the earliest possible stage to Senior Administration or the Operations Manager. RouteNote Ltd may terminate its relationship with a Supplier if it is in breach of this policy. Xyzaroom Records Inc. may elect to work with the Supplier to resolve the issue.</p>
  
  <p>The software/licensing business sector is not considered high risk in relation to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Company does not enter into intricate supply chains, have multiple levels of contracting or subcontracting, or partner with businesses based in impoverished regions of the world where labour/employment laws are minimal or poorly enforced.</p>
